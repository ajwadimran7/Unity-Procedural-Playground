# Procedural Audio Generation

Testing procedural audio generation at run-time in Unity. The applications of this system are endless since you can create non-predictable sounds/sfx for your projects.

Extending the system: Add different audio filters and play with the system until you are happy with the result. There are a lot more filters available in Unity to play with. I just used one of them for the demonstration purposes.
